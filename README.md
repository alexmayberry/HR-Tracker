  This command line interface app prompts you (as a manager) to enter information about yourself and your team and renders an HTML webpage with your team information.

  ## Video Walkthrough

  Also see the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18OP9irlBgBGir-6NOyEn_6DKNvaVeDkF/view) demonstrating how to run and test the app.

  ## Installation

  Clone down a copy of the app from the repo, open it in your text editor, and use npm to install the node dependancies to run the app.

  ## Usage

  Once dependancies are installed, run the app by typing `node index.js` in a terminal open to the root project directory. Then, simply answer the questions in the terminal and open the index.html file that is rendered.

  ## Testing

  to test the app, open an integrated terminal in the `tests` directory and type `npm run test`. Jest will run and the results will be displayed.

  ## Contribution

  Jump in! A good next step would be to create different style sheets render the team pages in different styles.
